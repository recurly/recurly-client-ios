# Recurly iOS SDK

The Recurly SDK allows you to integrate recurrent payments in your existing iOS app in a matter of minutes.

We encourage our partners to review Apple's guidelines on mobile application development. In particular, please review Section 11 to familiarize yourself with the purchases and currencies guidelines: <https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#purchasing-currencies>

By using the Recurly SDK, you can tokenize your users' payment information and safely use it to process transactions â€“ since sensitive payment information is passed on directly to Recurly, your PCI scope is drastically reduced.

## 1. Download
There are two ways to begin using the Recurly iOS SDK.

### Using CocoaPods
If you are currently using CocoaPods in your Xcode project (or would like to), simply add this line your `Podfile`.

```ruby
  pod 'RecurlySDK'
```

For more information on CocoaPods, visit: <http://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html>


### Using the RecurlySDK.framework
1. Download the framework from the releases page (or build it yourself using the `build.sh` script provided).
2. [Drop it in](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-structure_navigator/articles/Adding_a_Framework.html) your existing Xcode project.
3. RecurlySDK needs the following frameworks:
  - Foundation
  - UIKit
  - AddressBook
  - Security
  - CoreTelephony

4. Add the flag `-ObjC` to `Other Linker Flags` (located in Build Settings > Linking).


## 2. Import
Once the framework is added to your project (via either of the methods above) you only need to import the SDK headers.

```obj-c
#import <RecurlySDK/RecurlySDK.h>
```

## 3. Configure
In order to connect to the Recurly API, you must initialize the SDK with the API public key. This is found on the API credentials page of your Recurly site: <https://app.recurly.com/go/developer/api_access>

```obj-c
[Recurly configure:@"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"];
// after configuring, you can perform any operation with the SDK!
```

We strongly recommend that you configure the SDK when your application is launched (in your `AppDelegate.m`, for example).

```obj-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    [Recurly configure:@"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"];
    // continue initializing your app
}    
```

## 4. Examples
Once the SDK is imported and configured, we can start building stuff with it!
### Get a payment token

```obj-c
RECardRequest *card = [RECardRequest new];
card.number = @"4111111111111111";
card.cvv = @"123";
card.expirationMonth = 12;
card.expirationYear = 2015;
card.billingAddress.firstName = @"John";
card.billingAddress.lastName = @"Smith";
card.billingAddress.countryCode = @"US";

[Recurly tokenWithRequest:card completion:^(NSString *token, NSError *error) {
    if(!error) {
        // DO STUFF WITH THE TOKEN
    }
}];
```

or (exactly the same):

```obj-c
RECardRequest *card = [RECardRequest requestWithCardNumber:@"4111111111111111"
                                                       CVV:@"123"
                                                     month:12
                                                      year:2015
                                                 firstName:@"John"
                                                  lastName:@"Smith"
                                               countryCode:@"US"];

[Recurly tokenWithRequest:card completion:^(NSString *token, NSError *error) {
    if(!error) {
        // DO STUFF WITH THE TOKEN
    }
}];
```


### Get tax details for a specific locale

```obj-c
[Recurly taxForPostalCode:@"WA16 8GS"
              countryCode:@"GB"
               completion:^(RETaxes *tax, NSError *error)
{
    if(!error) {
        NSLog(@"The VAT imposed in that location is: %@%%", [[tax totalTax] decimalNumberByMultiplyingByPowerOf10:2]);
    }
}];
```

### Get the details of a plan

```obj-c
[Recurly planForCode:@"premium"
          completion:^(REPlan *plan, NSError *error) {
    if(!error) {
        NSLog(@"Plan info: %@", plan);
    }
}];
```

### Get the details of a coupon

```obj-c
[Recurly couponForPlan:@"premium"
                  code:@"123Win"
            completion:^(RECoupon *coupon, NSError *error)
{
    if(!error) {
        NSLog(@"Coupon info: %@", coupon);
    }
}];
```

## Validate input data manually

### Card number

```obj-c
if([REValidation validateCardNumber:@"4111 1111 1111 1111"]) {
    NSLog(@"Card number is valid");
}else{
    NSLog(@"Card number is invalid");
}
```

### CVV

```obj-c
if([REValidation validateCVV:@"123"]) {
    NSLog(@"CVV is valid");
}else{
    NSLog(@"CVV is invalid");
}
```


### Country code

```obj-c
if([REValidation validateCountryCode:@"US"]) {
    NSLog(@"Country code is valid");
}else{
    NSLog(@"Country code is invalid");
}
```


### Expiration date

```obj-c
if([REValidation validateExpirationMonth:11 year:20]) {
    NSLog(@"Expiration date is valid");
}else{
    NSLog(@"Expiration date is invalid");
}
```
