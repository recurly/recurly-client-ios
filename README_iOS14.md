# Recurly iOS SDK
![Recurly Client iOS](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-ios/actions/workflows/ci-test.yaml/badge.svg?branch=master)

due to the current Recurly iOS SDK 2.0.0 is not supporting project with minimum iOS14, changing popspec file in order to compile in the project. It works on iOS14 project build.
